6G Trust Issues Laboratory Guide
================================

Welcome to the 6G Trust Issues Laboratory! This repository serves as a laboratory for conducting experiments related to enhancing 6G security with a zero Trust Architecture, with a focus on dynamic trust assessment and anomaly detection.

Mission:
--------
The mission of this laboratory is to explore and develop innovative approaches to enhance the security of 6G networks. Specifically, we aim to achieve this by implementing a zero Trust Architecture that incorporates dynamic trust assessment and anomaly detection techniques.



Types of Zero Trust Architectures for 6G
1)Micro-Segmentation:
Divides the network into smaller, isolated segments.
Restricts lateral movement within the network.

2)Identity and Access Management (IAM):
Ensures that only authenticated and authorized users/devices can access network resources.
Uses multifactor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO), etc.

3)Continuous Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:
Continuously monitors network traffic and user behavior.
Detects and responds to anomalies in real-time.

4)Least Privilege Access:
Grants users and devices the minimum level of access necessary.
Reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

5)Network Access Control (NAC):
Controls access to the network based on policies.
Uses endpoint security measures to ensure compliance.

6)Policy-Based Security:
Defines and enforces security policies dynamically based on context.
Uses contextual information like user role, device type, location, etc.



OUR MAIN FOCUS SHALL BE ON Continuous Monitoring and Anomaly Detection since it aligns more with our objectives

Repository Structure:
---------------------
This repository follows a modular structure, with each Jupyter notebook representing an experiment. The notebooks are organized into different categories based on the specific aspect of 6G security they address.

Getting Started:
----------------
To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/lordskyzw/6gTrustIssues.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can find the list of dependencies and installation instructions in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. Explore the experiments by opening the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment.

Experiment Guidelines:
----------------------
1. Each Jupyter notebook represents a specific experiment. Read the experiment description and objectives before proceeding.

2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the experiment.

3. Analyze the results and observations obtained from each experiment.

4. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to further explore the concepts and techniques.


Conclusion:
-----------
By conducting experiments in this laboratory, we aim to advance the field of 6G security and contribute to the development of a zero Trust Architecture with dynamic trust assessment and anomaly detection capabilities.
