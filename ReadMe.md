## Introduction
In the era of 6G networks, where connectivity is ubiquitous and diverse, ensuring robust security becomes paramount. This readme provides an overview of our project, highlighting the key concepts and approaches we employ to enhance 6G security.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the increasing complexity and diversity of 6G networks, which introduces new challenges in terms of trust and security. By adopting a Zero Trust Architecture, we aim to mitigate these challenges and provide a more secure environment for 6G communication.

## Zero Trust Architecture
Zero Trust Architecture is a security framework that assumes no implicit trust, regardless of whether the communication occurs within or outside the network perimeter. It emphasizes continuous verification and strict access controls to protect against potential threats.

## Dynamic Trust Assessment
Dynamic Trust Assessment is a key component of our approach, enabling real-time evaluation of trust levels for network entities. By considering various contextual factors and behavioral patterns, we can dynamically adjust access privileges and detect potential trust violations.

## Anomaly Detection
Anomaly Detection plays a crucial role in identifying and mitigating security breaches. By leveraging machine learning and statistical techniques, we can detect abnormal behaviors and take proactive measures to prevent potential threats.
